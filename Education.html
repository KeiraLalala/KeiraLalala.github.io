    <h3>Education</h3>
    <br>
    <strong>Doctor of Philosophy (2020 - 2024)</strong>
        <br>Supervisors:  Dr Roland Goecke & Dr Damith Herath 
        <br><p>My thesis research focused on investigating how deep learning models can recognise and detect the micro- and macro-expressions, and explored the potential to assist in diagnosing depression. I developed a novel system that combines deep learning techniques and computer vision methods to preprocess source video data, normalise image samples, and extract significant expression features for final detection and classification. </p>
        <br>
        <br><p>The novelty of my research lies in the design of an end-to-end framework that is sensitive to subtle dynamic features, while effectively eliminating the effects of static facial characteristics. A key innovation of this work is the development of deep learning models that achieve high performance with limited data, overcoming the traditional challenge of requiring large datasets for training.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p>The final component of my PhD project involved spotting macro- and micro- expressions from long videos containing various intensities and time scales of facial movements. In other words, the system is designed to spot and extract significant information from noisy dynamic data.</p>
        <br>
    <strong>Master Student in Science and Technology (2018-2020)</strong>
        <br>Supervisors:  Dr Roland Goecke & Dr Damith Herath 
        <br><p>I began my research journey as a Master student in Science and Technology in August 2018 and advanced to a Master of Research student in 2019. During this period, I completed a comprehensive series of courses on machine learning and deep learning offered by DeepLearning.AI, earning a certification upon completion.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology (2008 - 2012)
        <br>
    </strong>
        <br>
        <br><p>I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science, during which I received practical training in programming across various languages, covering areas from hardware to web development. Additionally, I developed a comprehensive understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, including operating systems, mathematics, and analog/electrical circuits.</p>
