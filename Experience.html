    <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
    <br>
    <strong>University of Canberra:</strong> <italic>Researcher and Sessional Academic</italic>
        <br>Aug 2019 - Present
        <br><p>During my Ph.D. at the University of Canberra, I served as a researcher and sessional academic, engaging in both research and teaching activities. I instructed undergraduate courses in programming, computer vision, databases, and mathematics. My role involved guiding students through complex course materials in tutorials, imparting problem-solving skills, and meticulously assessing their assignments. I received a "high performance" evaluation in the sessional development plan for my contributions to the "Mathematical Methods" (course 577). Additionally, I actively contributed to academic projects in computer vision and machine learning, with a specific focus on affective computing.</p>
    <strong>University of Canberra:</strong> <italic>HDR Student Representative</italic>
        <br>Feb 2021 - Aug 2023
        <br><p>I served as the Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students' representative on the Faculty of Science and Technology Research Committee (FRC) at the University of Canberra. Over two years, I consistently attended monthly meetings, actively advocated for HDR students' rights, and relayed key meeting outcomes back to the student body. I also played a crucial role in providing feedback on student needs and participating in scholarship assessments.</p>
    <strong>Self-employed </strong> <italic>Personal English Tutor</italic>
        <br>Personal English Tutor
        <br><p>I worked as a personal tutor, specializing in preparing clients for the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE). Utilizing my expertise in English and knowledge of AI-based oral recognition systems, I tailored my approach to each student's needs, helping them achieve high scores in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. I maintained a blog to share free study materials and support a wider learning community.</p>
