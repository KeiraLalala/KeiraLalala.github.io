Hi, welcome to Keira's profile website! I proudly identify as a computer vision and machine learning scientist specializing in affective computing. On this site, I'll share insights into my research interests, skills, experiences, and topics related to my field of study. I hope to give you a deeper understanding of both my professional journey and the areas that captivate my curiosity.

My journey into computer science began nearly 16 years ago and quickly captivated me with how commands and code weave the fabric of the digital world. Fortuitously, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, exploring how computer vision and machine learning can understand, learn from, and assist in addressing issues that exist in reality. Along the way, I've honed my skills in designing, constructing, training, and evaluating deep learning models, and in implementing various computer vision techniques through widely-used machine learning libraries.

I will be awarded a Ph.D. with a research focus on affective computingâ€”a field that merges psychology, cognitive science, and computer science to develop technology that can understand and simulate human emotions. My specific interest lies in micro-expression recognition and detection. Micro-expressions, which reflect genuine emotions without concealment, have immense potential for applications like depression diagnosis. In my quest to accurately capture and recognize these subtle expressions, I have made several contributions through publications and by presenting complex ideas in engaging stories for the public.

Beyond academia, I like to spend my time in a 25-square-meter lush garden at my home. All life here adds vibrant vitality to my life, their tenacious spirit fuels my ambitions, and their growth cycles remind me to maintain a balance between work and leisure. I also enjoy painting, singing, rock climbing, and recently, I've taken up figure skating. Exploring new hobbies keeps my passion for work and study alive.
