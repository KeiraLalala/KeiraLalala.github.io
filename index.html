title: Hi I'm Keira  
subtitle: Computer Vision and Machine Learning Research Scientist
---

Hi! I’m Keira, and I proudly identify myself as a Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML) engineer and scientist. I am actively seeking roles related to CV & ML because of my passion for applying these technologies to solve real-world challenges. With a robust background in computer science, I am well-equipped to excel in roles such as AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and AI Research Scientist. I am articulate and excel in teamwork, eager to bring my expertise and enthusiasm to a team that values innovation and a forward-thinking approach. If you have opportunities where my skills could be utilized, please feel free to explore an overview of my background, projects, skills, and experience, and reach out to me!

I have over 11 years of experience in software development, ML Engineering, and ML Ops/DevOps. My hands-on experience in Python includes implementing various deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, and Transformer, alongside several computer vision techniques for affective computing tasks. In these projects, I’ve designed pre-trained models, handled data preprocessing, and constructed attention modules. I have also integrated computer vision elements, including optical flow algorithms for dynamic feature extraction, motion magnification for subtle feature amplification, and Grad-CAM heatmap algorithms to assess model training conditions.

My research interests focus on applying spatio-temporal models and other computer vision techniques to recognize and detect micro-expressions. In pursuit of these interests, I have published and presented affective computing research at several international conferences, including ICIP and ICMI. Beyond academic contributions, I engage in public presentations to explain my research to the wider public. Additionally, articles summarizing my experiences with micro-expression recognition and detection are available in blog.
