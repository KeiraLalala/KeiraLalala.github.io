On this site, I'll share insights into my **research interests**, **skills**, **experiences**, and **topics** related to my field of study. I hope to give you a deeper understanding of both my professional journey and the areas that captivate my curiosity.

My journey into computer science began nearly 16 years ago, and fortuitously, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of AI 6 years ago, exploring how computer vision and machine learning can understand, learn from, and assist in addressing issues that exist in reality. Along the way, I've honed my skills in designing, constructing, training, and evaluating deep learning models, and in implementing various computer vision techniques through widely-used machine learning libraries.

I will be awarded a Ph.D. with a research focus on affective computing. My specific interest lies in micro-expression recognition and detection, which has immense potential for applications like depression diagnosis. I have made several contributions through publications and by presenting complex ideas in engaging stories for the public.

Beyond academia, I like to spend my time in my lush garden. All life here adds vibrant vitality to my life. I also enjoy painting, singing, rock climbing, and recently, I've taken up figure skating. Exploring new hobbies keeps my passion for work and study alive.
